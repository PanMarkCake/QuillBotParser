## What Is Network Automation?

Network automation is the process of using software and automation tools to manage and control network devices and infrastructure. It involves automating configuration, deployment, monitoring, and troubleshooting processes, leading to increased network agility, consistency, and reliability.

Instead of relying on manual processes, automation executes these tasks according to pre-defined policies and workflows. This is often achieved using script-based approaches, configuration management tools, or automation platforms.

Benefits of network automation include:

*   **Increased efficiency**: Automation reduces manual effort, allowing IT teams to focus on more strategic tasks.
*   **Reduced errors:**Automation minimizes human error in configuration and deployment, leading to greater network stability.
*   **Faster deployment:**Automating deployment processes speeds up the delivery of new services and applications.
*   **Improved scalability:**Automation makes it easier to scale the network infrastructure to meet changing demands.
*   **Cost savings:**By reducing manual effort and improving efficiency, network automation can lead to significant cost savings.
*   **Enhanced security:**Automation can improve security by ensuring consistent security policies and rapid response to security threats.Only a networking equipment manufacturer can deliver everything you need in such a way that helps position your network for now and later.
